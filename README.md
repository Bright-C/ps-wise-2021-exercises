# Programming Styles -- WiSe 20-21
--------

In this repository you find the  exercises for the Programming Style class. 

The solutions of the exercise will be published in due time, i.e., after each Zoom session.

## Sessions Organization
All the exercise sessions start at **08:30** and they will be held on Zoom. The link to participate to the Zoom meetings is posted on StudIP and [here](https://uni-passau.zoom.us/j/95352368432?pwd=T1pwNlNjZnhxUzRuL2NzSXNuK3o3UT09)

Each session will follow more or less the same organization.

1. We start by discussing issues related to the video-lectures.
2. Next, we discuss issues related to the assignments.
3. Then, we discuss the exercises and their solution. 

> The description of all the exercises is given since day one, so you should solve the exercise **before** the session. You can even submit your solution using a GitHub Pull Request so we can discuss it during the zoom meeting.

## Feedback and Questions
At any point, you can ask questions by posting them to the [StudIP forum of the class](https://studip.uni-passau.de/studip/plugins.php/coreforum/index?cid=f77f1ea6f3e5ff22658cafe37ac37b66).


## Sharing is Caring
As always, you can contribute to this repository by creating issues and submitting Pull Request. Examples of valid contributions are definition of new exercises and solutions to old exercises with different programming languages, including **but not limited to** Java and Javascript.

> So if you are familiar with other programming languages you can submit the solution of the exercises using them (in addition to solving the exercises in Python!)
